                As an Senior project, I decided to forge my own path, to the
                design and build a smart virtual personal assistant named Jady,
                for entrepreneurs. The motivation for this personal initiative
                was to design something that would make a real difference in
                people's lives. something more than the design of the hundredth
                websites or applications.
